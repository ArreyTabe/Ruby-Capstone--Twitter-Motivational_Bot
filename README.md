## How to Install

`afftech` uses the `dotenv` gem in order to access Environment Variables for the required API key and Twitter access tokens.

Follow the next steps to configure all that's needed:

- Install Ruby in your system. To install Ruby, you can read the [Documentation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
  If you have installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) in your system, you can clone it using **git clone** command.
- Clone the project by running `https://github.com/ArreyTabe/Ruby-Capstone--Twitter-Motivational_Bot.git` on Terminal/CMD or download and extract it from the repository. OR
  Download it as a [Zip File](https://github.com/ArreyTabe/Ruby-Capstone--Twitter-Motivational_Bot.git`).
- Open Terminal/CMD and cd into the the folder you downloaded or cloned.
- Execute `touch .env` from the projects root directory
- make sure you have a [twitter devolper account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access), go to your dashboard and while still logged into your twitter account,the first thing you want to do is create a new app. For convenience, use the same name as your account.
- Adjust the permissions to `Read and write`
- Next, go to the API Keys page and click ‚ÄúGenerate my Access Token,‚Äù and then copy:

- **Consumer Key**

- **Consumer Secret**

- **Access Token**

- **Access Token Secret**

- On your `.env` file add your token like this:

- config.consumer_key = "YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY"
- config.consumer_secret = "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET"
- config.access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
- config.access_token_secret = "YOUR_ACCESS_SECRET"

- Run `bundle install` from the project's root directory to install dependencies.
- Run `bundle exec bin/main.rb'
- Navigate to your twitter account

## How to Test the Methods In the Classes

Install Rspec gem in your system. To do this:

Open Command Prompt or Terminal and run:

```console
gem install Rspec
```

Navigate into the spec folder and run the following at the console:

```console
testing_tweetbot_spec.rb
```

## Deployment to Heroku

In order to deploy the bot to Heroku you need a free Heroku account and follow the next steps:

- Go to your [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) and click on the `New` button located on the top-right corner.

- Click on `Create new app` and then give it a name.
- Select a Deployment Method. GitHub is the easiest one since you only need to provide your credentials. To deploy from GitHub you need to have a copy of the source code hosted there, so do that before selecting GitHub as deployment method.

<b>Remember NOT to commit API credentials to public places.</b> The `.gitignore` file should handle that already but make sure you're not doing it.

- Set your API Credentials in Heroku as Environment Variables by clicking on the `Settings` tab and then adding them to the `Config Vars` section.
- Go to the `Resources` tab on Heroku and click on the pencil icon to edit the Heroku Dyno.
- Turn it on and click on Confirm. Once you do that everything should be ready.
